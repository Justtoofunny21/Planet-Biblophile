                <div class="rating">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</div>
                <p>Review by Morayo:</p>
                <p>
                    "The Midnight Library" is a beautifully crafted story that explores the infinite possibilities of life through the lens of regret and hope. Each page invites you to reflect on your own choices and the paths not taken. Haig's writing is both poignant and uplifting, making this a must-read for anyone who has ever wondered 'what if?' It's a perfect blend of philosophy and storytelling that leaves you inspired and eager to embrace life’s possibilities.
